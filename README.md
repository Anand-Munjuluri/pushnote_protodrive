# PushNote Documentation

## Introduction
Welcome to **PushNote**, a task management application designed specifically for small and medium-scale organizations. Built using React and optimized for mobile devices, PushNote streamlines your workflow and enhances productivity.

## User Roles and Functionalities
PushNote caters to three distinctive user roles: Admins, Managers, and Employees. Each role is equipped with specific functionalities to ensure seamless task allocation and monitoring within the organization.

### Admins
Admins are the focal point of control, responsible for overseeing the organization's cloud storage and managing task assignments. They can effortlessly add tasks, assign them to specific managers, and monitor the real-time progress of each task across the entire organization.

### Managers
Managers play a pivotal role in task distribution and supervision. They can effortlessly add employees to the system, assign tasks to their team members, and conveniently track the status of these tasks. Managers can also update the status of their own tasks, ensuring clear communication and real-time progress updates for the Admin's overview.

### Employees
Employees are the key workforce responsible for executing the assigned tasks. With easy access to their task lists, employees can efficiently update task statuses, ensuring transparent communication and streamlined progress tracking within the organization.

## Authentication
PushNote prioritizes security by implementing a robust Firebase-based authentication system. Users can seamlessly register and log in using their Google accounts, ensuring a secure and hassle-free experience.

## Stress Relief Feature
In addition to its task management capabilities, PushNote cares about the well-being of its users. We have integrated a stress relief meditation audio feature, allowing users to take a moment to relax and rejuvenate, promoting a healthier and more productive work environment.

## Enabling Mobile Mode on Desktop
Although PushNote is optimized for mobile devices, you can still access it on your desktop by enabling mobile mode in your browser's developer tools. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open **Developer Tools** in your browser (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
2. Click on the **Toggle Device Toolbar** button (or press `Ctrl+Shift+M`).
3. Select a mobile device from the dropdown list at the top of the screen.
4. Refresh the page.

Now you can use PushNote on your desktop as if you were on a mobile device!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
